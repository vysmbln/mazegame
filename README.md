### Challenges:

>***How to generate the maze?***
by Using an algorithm to generate a maze. We will learn about data structure + recursion to implement simplest algorithm


>***How to draw the maze on the screen?***
by using MatterJS to draw maze


>***How to make some keyboard to control the ball?***
MatterJS has the ablity to map press movement to shapes

>***How to detect when the ball touch the green square***
MatterJS has the ability to detect collisions between different shapes and report back as an event


### BUILDING THE MAZE: 
1. Create index.html, index.js //Add matter.js cdn and index.js on index.html.

2. On index.js add: 

- [x]  require objects from matter.js library(Engine, Render, Runner, World, Bodies, Body, Events) so we can use them on the file.

- [x] add the canvas
- [x] add the walls

3. Create a layout for the maze:

4. Maze generation.

5. Create a variables for starting row and column.

6. Create new variables for grid, verticals and horizontals.

7. Iterate horizontals and verticals.

8. Create variable : unitLength.

9. Create var for goal(end).

10. Create varriable for ball(start).

11. Create var for moving the ball up,down, left,right.

12. Create variable for Game over/Win condition

13. Add forEach array to make the wall collapse

14. Refactor code(Make sure that we will always have identical width and height): 
- [x] add css on index.html (to change the color)
- [x] edit const height and width 
- [x] remove cell variable and replace with cellHorizontal/cellVertical
- [x] edit cons unitLength to const unitLengthY and const unitLengthY
- [x] update the color of wall, ball, and end
15. Add 'You win' on index.html
